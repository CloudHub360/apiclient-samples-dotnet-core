# CloudHub360 API .net core sample code

This repository contains sample .net core (C#) code that demonstrates how to interact with the CloudHub360 API.

This code is intended for illustration, and quick start/evaluation rather and should not be considered an "SDK". In particular, in production care extra consideration should be given to handling transient network issues etc. and throttling requests so as to not hit API limits.
